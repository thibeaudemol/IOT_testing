0.0.4: added RTOS_Print_Stats() method to print info about current running thread
0.0.5: added debug flag to makefile, so certain prints will only be done under debug mode

        - fixed some bugs from version 0.0.7
        - removed RTOS_Print_Stats on BTN 2
        - removed grow project from stack, due to too many duplicate files
0.1.1: cleaned up some code, removing several warnings in the process
0.2.0: removed common platform, which cleaned up a lot of undefined warnings.
0.2.1:  - fixed debugging with cortex-debug when DEBUG flag is disabled
        - re added common platform, for generic error, print and assert handlers
0.2.2: added assert() handler as well, fixing the assert() calls in the murata driver
0.3.0:  - updated UART interrupt flow with function pointers
        - updated GPIO interrupt flow with function pointers
        - updated RTC wakeup interrupt flow with function pointers
0.3.1:  - added versioning to shield drivers
        - update printwelcome function to display shield info
0.3.2:  - split up payloadparser(configparser) from app to platfor/common
        - adding unit testing tools to testing folder, as wel as first unit test for payloadparser & dns
0.3.3:  - clean of printwelcome, printing appname and version in one line
        - copy binary with version name to release folder per application
0.3.4:  - added support for PRINT_RTOS_STATS 0 in app makefile, disabling BTN2 interrupt, is 1 by default
        - disabled "feed IWDG" prints
0.3.5:  - major changes to tickless mode, significantly reducing stop mode power consumption
0.3.6:  - moved commonly used datatypes to datatypes.h in core/platform/inc/datatypes.h
0.3.7:  - printing octa_UID in dec as well as u64 le hex string
0.4.0: changed from specific flash drivers per platform to generic octa-flash driver
0.4.1: changed printwelcome to print chip specific nb-iot info
0.4.2: changes RTOS_STATS to be 0 by default, less console spam this way
0.4.3:  - updated flash driver, now correctly sets 4B addressing mode for octa-stm
        - decreased the delays in the BQ35100 batterylevel sensor init function
0.4.4: moved hard_reset and wd_reset to platform init code, now every app can use it
0.4.5: added new octa-protocol header and payload types to octa-protocol-types.h
0.5.0: changed application folder to have subfolders as this was getting to much
0.5.1: added BTN_MAG to octa-stm gpio, also added interrupt callback support for it
0.5.2: added last_known_timestamp to octa_config struct, used for rough initial sense of time
0.5.3: changed make release command, no creates .hex, .bin and .elf in release folder
0.5.4:  - changed last_msg_acked from int32_t to uint32_t, making it more in line with flash_index
        - added octa-protocol-downlink-parser to payloadparser, updated unit tests
0.5.5: added PWM leds to octa platform, see leds.c/h files
0.5.6: added octa-stm-mini platform to stack
0.5.7: removed NB_IOT_PROVIDER from every app makefile using nordic9160, nonw using auto provider selection
0.5.8: added -fcommon flag to core makefile, fixes compatibility with newer arm gcc compilers: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html
